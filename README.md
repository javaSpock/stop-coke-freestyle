Stop Coca-Cola Freestyle&reg;
=============================

This is a simple GitHub Pages site. Its purposes are four-fold:

1. To give me a reason to personally learn GitHub Pages and Jekyll
2. To alert the general public to the shortcomings of the Freestyle soda fountain
3. To urge The Coca-Cola Company to correct the error of its ways
4. To have a little fun

The site is (read: *will eventually be*) found here: http://javaSpock.github.io/stop-coke-freestyle
